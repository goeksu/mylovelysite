My humble personal website. Humble as PHP. 
For further information about simpleness: www.motherfuckingwebsite.com

<h2>PunnyCode</h2>
This website uses punnycode on safari browser. Have you ever seen an URL like: ðŸ“Ÿahmet.goksu.in ?
this is actually xn--ahmet-fo14d.goksu.in, only safari is able to process it by default. You can check here: https://www.punycoder.com

<h2>Dynamic Title</h2>
I dont really know is that good for SEO but everytime you refresh the page you may notice the changing title. 

<h2>Metamask Connection</h2>
This was the simplest thing in thoose that I call creative touches. A simple JS code checks for metamask wallet and connects if awailable. So website greet the user not only by the IP.
